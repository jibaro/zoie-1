Moscow (CNN) -- The military attache of Israel's embassy in Russia has been expelled from the country for gathering intelligence there, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on its website Thursday.

The attache is Vadim Leiderman, a representative of Israel's Defense Ministry.

"The Russian Foreign Ministry confirms the information that military attache V. Leiderman of the Israeli Embassy in Moscow was detained directly in the act of receiving intelligence from a Russian citizen in Moscow on May 12.

"In connection with the activities incompatible with Leiderman's diplomatic status, the Russian Foreign Ministry has expressed protest and declared him persona non grata.

"A note has been passed to the Israeli side saying that Leiderman must leave the Russian Federation within 48 hours, which he has done," the Russian Foreign Ministry statement said.

The Israel Defense Forces Wednesday said the probe of Col. Leiderman was a "surprise" and disputed the suspicions of spying.

"Defense officials in Israel did a thorough, deep check on Col. Leiderman and discovered the claims were unfounded. Col. Leiderman is currently in Israel and underwent a security investigation by defense forces over the weekend," the IDF said.
